## Description
Single REST API which demonstrates dependencies decoupling when our applications relies on 3rd party services.
In this case we rely on a Storage Cloud Provider, we need to make sure it is easily switchable to another cloud provider.<br><br>
**Note: Testing with GCP/AWS/Azure might involve some real charges to your account, please be aware of it and follow [Steps to test](#steps-to-test) in order to avoid unnecessary charges**

## Google Cloud Platform

### Instructions
1. Download/clone this repo locally
2. Set up GCS Bucket, SA and IAM permissions. See [How to set up GCS](#set-up-gcs) for more details.
3. Modify appsettings.json.
   - Change **GCS** section:
     - BucketName: globally unique bucket name created.
     - ServiceAccountKeyFileName: downloaded json file's name with SA's key. See steps 5-7 of [How to set up GCS](#set-up-gcs)
4. Run migrations by executing over **CloudStorage.Core**: Update-Database in "Package Manager Console". Note: sometime it's necessary install first: Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
